# Setting up the Environment

For this class, I recommend using Conda combined with Visual Studio Code (yes, it's from Microsoft!). I believe this to be the easiest and fastest setup across all platforms.

## Linux

For this class, I recommend the use of Linux, preferably Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. Why? Because this is the system I am most familiar with, so I can effectively assist you with any problems. However, if you prefer Windows or macOS, that's fine too! I will still help, but resolving issues might take longer as we'll need to search for solutions online.

### Installing Conda on Linux

1. **Download Miniconda Installer**:

   **Option A - Using wget (easiest method, recommended for CREMI machines):**

   On CREMI machines and Linux in general, the easiest way to download Miniconda is directly from the terminal using `wget`:
   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```
   This will download the installer to your current directory. Then skip to step 5 to run the installer.

   **Option B - Using a browser:**
   - Visit the [Miniconda download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
   - Select the `Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit` installer for Linux.

2. **Open Terminal**:
   - Open your terminal after downloading.

3. **Navigate to the Download Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where Miniconda was downloaded, usually the `Downloads` folder:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     ```

4. **Check if the .sh file is in the folder**:
   ```bash
   ls 

   # Expected file:
   Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

5. **Run the Installer**:
   - Execute the installer script:
     ```bash
     bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
     ```

6. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**:
   - Accept the license agreement by pressing `Enter` continuously. (Note: you need to go through the entire license agreement, so just hold down `Enter`. I know, it's tedious.)
   - Type `yes` to proceed with the installation.
   - Press `Enter` to accept the default installation location.
   - The installation might take a few minutes.

7. **Initialize Conda**:
   - At the end, the installer will ask if you wish to initialize Miniconda. Type `yes`.
   - This adds Conda to your PATH and enables Conda commands from the terminal.

8. **Close and Reopen Terminal**:
   - Close the terminal and reopen it for changes to take effect.

9. **Verify Installation**:
   - Run `conda list` to confirm a successful installation.

### Create an Environment

Once installed, create a Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name dm_web python=3.11
``` 
This creates an environment named `dm_web` with Python 3.11 as the default.

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate dm_web
```

Now, install some essential libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

If all goes well, you're ready to start!

### Installing Visual Studio Code

1. **Download the Visual Studio Installer**:
   - Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
   - Choose the Linux installer (the one with the penguin). For Debian systems, select the .deb installer.

2. **Open Terminal**:
   - Open your terminal after downloading.

3. **Navigate to the Download Directory**:
   - Use `cd` to go to the directory where the installer was downloaded, usually the `Downloads` folder:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     ```

4. **Check if the .deb file is in the folder**:
   ```bash
   ls 

   # Expected file:
   code_1.85.2-1705561292_amd64.deb
   ```

5. **Run the Installer**:
   - Execute the installer script. *Note: Superuser privileges are required to install VSCode.*:
     ```bash
     sudo dpkg -i code_1.85.2-1705561292_amd64.deb 
     ```

6. **Initialize VSCode**:
   - After installation, open VSCode from the "Show Applications" menu or using the `code` command in the terminal.

## Defining the Work Environment in VSCode

Now, let's prepare our VSCode setup. These steps apply to Linux, Windows, and macOS.

**Note for macOS users:** Replace `Ctrl` with `Cmd` for keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Cmd + Shift + P` instead of `Ctrl + Shift + P`).

1. First, create a folder for our first project and open it in VSCode.

2. Next, set up our Conda environment in VSCode. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, type `select interpreter`, and choose the `dm_web` environment. To check if it's working, open a new terminal from "Terminal" -> "New Terminal". If it's working, you'll see the Conda environment name in the terminal. Try a simple "hello world" program to test.

3. VSCode offers helpful extensions. Install the following:
   - Python
   - Pylance
   - Jupyter

4. Test our Jupyter notebook setup by creating a `test.ipynb` file. Try executing a cell with a simple Python command (use `Ctrl + Enter`). VSCode will prompt you to select the Python interpreter again. Choose `dm_web`. You may be asked to install `Ipykernel`. After installation, you should be able to run Jupyter cells.


Congratulations! You now have a functional environment with VSCode, Jupyter, and the necessary tools!
