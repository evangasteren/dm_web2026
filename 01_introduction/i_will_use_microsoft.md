# Windows Setup

Oh... I see you've decided to use Windows. Don't worry, nobody's perfect!

## Installing Conda on Windows

1. **Download Miniconda Installer**:
   - Visit the [Miniconda download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
   - Select the `Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit` installer for Windows.

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - After downloading, double-click the installer executable (`Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe`) to run it.

3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**:
   - Click 'Next' on the installer window.
   - Accept the license agreement by selecting 'I agree' and click 'Next'.
   - Choose the installation location or leave it as the default, then click 'Next'.
   - Select 'Just Me' as the installation type and click 'Next'.
   - Check the option to "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable" (optional but recommended).
   - The installation will begin and may take a few minutes.

4. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + S` and search for 'Anaconda Powershell' or 'Anaconda Prompt' to open a new terminal window.
   - Alternatively, you can use Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt if you added Miniconda to PATH.

5. **Verify Installation**:
   - Run the following command to verify that Conda is installed:
     ```bash
     conda --version
     ```

## Install Essential Libraries

For this class, we will use the `base` environment that comes with Conda. If you see `(base)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, it worked!

Now, install some essential libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install ipykernel
```

If all goes well, you're ready to start!

## Installing Visual Studio Code

1. **Download the Visual Studio Code Installer**:
   - Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
   - Choose the Windows installer.

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - After downloading, double-click the installer executable (`VSCodeSetup-x64.exe`) to run it.

3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**:
   - Click 'Next' on the installer window.
   - Select the installation location or leave it as the default, then click 'Next'.
   - Choose whether you want to create desktop and Start menu shortcuts, then click 'Next'.
   - Click 'Install' to begin the installation.

4. **Initialize Visual Studio Code**:
   - After installation, you can open Visual Studio Code from the Start menu or by searching for 'Visual Studio Code' in the taskbar search.

You have now successfully installed Conda and Visual Studio Code on Windows.
